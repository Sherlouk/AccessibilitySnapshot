AccessibilitySnapshots makes it simple to add regression tests for accessibility in UIKit.

## Getting Started

By default, AccessibilitySnapshot uses [iOSSnapshotTestCase](https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case) to record snapshots and perform comparisons. Before setting up accessibility snapshot tests, make sure your project is set up for standard snapshot testing. Accessibility snapshot tests require that the test target has a host application. See the [Extensions](#extensions) section below for a list of other available snapshotting options.

### CocoaPods

Install with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) by adding the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'AccessibilitySnapshot'
```

To use only the core accessibility parser, add a dependency on the Core subspec alone.

```ruby
pod 'AccessibilitySnapshot/Core'
```

## Usage

To run a snapshot test, simply call the `SnapshotVerifyAccessibility` method:

```swift
func testAccessibility() {
    let view = MyView()
    // Configure the view...

    SnapshotVerifyAccessibility(view)
}
```

Since AccessibilitySnapshot is built on top of iOSSnapshotTestCase, it uses the same mechanism to record snapshots (setting the `self.recordMode` property) and supports many of the same features like device agnostic file names and specifying identifiers for each snapshot:

```swift
func testAccessibility() {
    let view = MyView()
    // Configure the view...

    SnapshotVerifyAccessibility(view, identifier: "identifier")
}
```

Snapshots can also optionally include indicators for the accessibility activation point of each element. By default, these indicators are shown when the activation point is different than the default activation point for that view. You can override this behavior for each snapshot:

```swift
func testAccessibility() {
    let view = MyView()
    // Configure the view...

    // Show indicators for every element.
    SnapshotVerifyAccessibility(view, showActivationPoints: .always)

    // Don't show any indicators.
    SnapshotVerifyAccessibility(view, showActivationPoints: .never)
}
```

You can also run accessibility snapshot tests from Objective-C:

```objc
- (void)testAccessibility;
{
    UIView *view = [UIView new];
    // Configure the view...

    SnapshotVerifyAccessibility(view, @"identifier");
}
```
